I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student at the [State Key Lab of CAD&CG](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/english.html), [Zhejiang University (ZJU)](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), advised by [Prof. Kun Zhou](http://www.kunzhou.net/) (ACM/IEEE Fellow).

Previously, I obtained my M.Phil. degree from [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/) in 2025, where I was advised by [Prof. Yuzhe Ma](https://www.yuzhe-ma.com/). I received my B.E. degree in Microelectronics from [Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU)](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/) in 2023.

My research interests primarily lie in **Computer Graphics** and **AI for Science**. I am particularly interested in **Physics-based Simulation** and applying machine learning techniques (such as PINNs and Operator Learning) to solve complex physical problems.
