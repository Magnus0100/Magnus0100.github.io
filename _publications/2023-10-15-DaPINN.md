**Abstract:**
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have shown great potential in solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, they often suffer from slow convergence and low accuracy when dealing with high-dimensional multi-physics problems. In this paper, we propose **DaPINN** (Dimension-augmented PINN), which incorporates a dimension-augmented strategy to construct the loss function. We apply this method to simulate the coupled electrical-thermal-stress fields in VLSI interconnects. Experimental results demonstrate that DaPINN achieves significantly higher accuracy and faster convergence speed compared to standard PINN and other variants.
