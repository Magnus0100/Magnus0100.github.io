**Abstract:**
Signal delay matching is a crucial constraint in many Photonic Integrated Circuit (PIC) applications, such as optical phased arrays and interferometers. Manual routing to achieve delay matching is tedious and error-prone. In this work, we propose an automatic routing framework for PICs under strict delay matching constraints. Our approach optimizes for minimal insertion loss and waveguide crossings while ensuring precise path length matching, significantly improving design efficiency and circuit performance.
