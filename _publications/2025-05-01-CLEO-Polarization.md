**Abstract:**
Polarization control is essential for high-speed optical communications and photonic computing. In this work, we present a compact integrated silicon photonic processor designed for real-time polarization management. By leveraging efficient on-chip interferometers and feedback control algorithms, our device achieves high-speed and precise polarization state manipulation with a significantly reduced footprint compared to traditional solutions.
