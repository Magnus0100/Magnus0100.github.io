**Abstract:**
Thermal crosstalk is a critical issue in Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs). Traditional Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations are accurate but computationally expensive. In this work, we propose **ThermoPhoton**, a learning-based framework that utilizes operator learning to predict the 3D thermal distribution of PICs. Our method achieves millisecond-level simulation speed with high accuracy, enabling efficient thermal-aware design automation.
